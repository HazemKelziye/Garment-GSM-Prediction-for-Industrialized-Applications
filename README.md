# Estimating the GSM of Raw Fabric for Industrialized Applications

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a robust tool for estimating the GSM (Grams per Square Meter) of circular knitted raw fabric in industrial settings. The accurate measurement of GSM is critical
for maintaining quality control, optimizing material usage, and ensuring the end product meets the required standards.
This tool is designed to streamline the process,
reduce errors, and increase efficiency in fabric production.
